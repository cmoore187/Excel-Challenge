Excel Homework
1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

  The theatre parent category and more specifically the sub catgory of plays has the highest number of succesfull projects as well as total projects by a wide margin.
  On the other hand, Journalism had the least by a large margin. 
  Another conclusion we could make about this data is that December would be a bad time to start a project.

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

  One limitation would be the data doesnt provide reasons for projects cancelling and or failing so we cannot draw a conclusion on whether certain categories are more
  susceptible to cancelling and failing than others since it doesn't provide data on whether there are outside forces causing the cancelled/failed project. 
  
  This data also doesn't take into fact that it could be skewed by including the years kickstarter first launched. The amount of users are less on average in the beginning 
  years as expected than the later years when kickstarter became more well-known or vetted so to speak.

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  We could create another table showing the average time it takes to have a succesful project using date created to date ended as well as goal set for parent categories to give 
  people an idea about how long it may take to complete your project based on what goal youre thinking of setting and what category your project would be listed as.
